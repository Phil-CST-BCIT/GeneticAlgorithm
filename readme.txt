Genetic Algorithm in C++

Author: Phil Teng

About the project
This is a C++ implementation of Generic Algorithm.

Prerequisites
In order to run the program, you need to have the latest gcc installed on your computer.

How to run the program
1. fork or clone the repo
2. cd to the working folder
3. compile the src with gcc
4. run the executable file
